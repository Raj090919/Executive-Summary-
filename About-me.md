As a seasoned professional, I bring a versatile background in Product/System Thermal Management, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), NPI Project Management, Supplier & Cross-functional Team Management, and NPI Product Testing and Validation. My expertise lies in managing DC communication products, with a particular focus on Optical Transceivers, AOCs, and Switches designed for data centers and AI applications.

My skill set encompasses providing technical guidance, leveraging cutting-edge design and CFD simulation tools, and optimizing thermal performance tailored specifically for DC networking applications. In my role as a Senior Thermal Engineer, I lead my team in enhancing product thermal performance through the implementation of both active and passive cooling solutions. Additionally, I play a pivotal role in resolving quality issues and oversee product DVT and reliability testing essential for NPI product qualification.

Acknowledging the significance of my technical contributions, I have been entrusted with overseeing customer account management, handling five Tier-1 customers from the USA, Japan, and India. In this capacity, my primary focus is on nurturing strong customer relationships, promptly introducing and showcasing new products, addressing customer quality concerns, meticulously completing CCAR reports, managing RFQs, QBRs, and other sales-related tasks, while effectively representing our company before our valued customers.
